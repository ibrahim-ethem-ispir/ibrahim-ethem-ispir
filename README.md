I am studying at Kahramanmaraş Sütçü İmam University. 🎓. I have decided to become a software developer with my interest in technology since I was a child and I am improving myself in this field 💡. I take care to discover new technologies and to use the technologies I have used in the most accurate and reliable way. ✨Apart from these, I prepare videos that can be useful for beginners and software developers on my youtube channel. 👨🏻‍💻. I'm currently into Web Development 🕸️ and working on my Data Structures and Algorithms 🤓.

Joined Github **1** years ago.
